Title: [Project] FinChronicle now has community voting for features!

Body:
Hey r/opensource!

We've just launched community voting for our finance tracker app.

Instead of guessing what users want, we're letting the community vote on features with GitHub Discussions.

Current top contenders:
- Budget tracking with alerts
- Recurring transactions (subscriptions)
- Charts and visualizations
- CSV import from other apps
- Advanced search and filters

Each feature has a detailed proposal with use cases, mockups, and implementation details.

Would love your feedback and votes!
